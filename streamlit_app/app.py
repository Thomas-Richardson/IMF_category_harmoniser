  ## How do I use this app?
  Say you have a dataset of household consumption for a country. You want to compare household consumption in this country to another country. If both countries used the IMF consumption categories, no problem.
  
  But this is often not the case! What do you do if your dataset uses different categories to those used by the IMF?
            
  You could manually map your categories to the IMF ones, but what if we could do this automatically using AI?
  
  This app does exactly that!
            
  Simply upload your dataset and select the column that has category data in it. We'll use AI to identify the IMF categories most similar to the ones in your data. You can then download your data back again with the IMF categories added.

    #### A note about OpenAI API keys
    We're using an AI model by OpenAI. It costs money to run, but in our case that amount is totally trivial (less than 1 US cent). Nonetheless, you'll need to get an OpenAI account, generate an API key and attach a credit card to it. This app does not store any data.
    Get an OpenAI account here: t.ly/Jrt8D then follow instructions to generate an API key.
